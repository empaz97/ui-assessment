## About

### Decisions

`Changes are Transient`

Since this is just a simple react-based app, I decided to not worry about writing back to a file backup. So, upon refreshing the page, all deleted albums are restored.

`Why React?`

### Bootstrap

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
