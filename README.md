## Music Library UI Assessment

Given the albums.json, create a simple UI that can do the following
1. Display the albums as a list of UI components. Each component should render the album artwork image, title, and artist
2. Sort the albums by its properties: artist name, album name.
3. Remove albums from the music library.

A mock-up has been included to provide visual guidance. Your UI does not have to perfectly match the mock-up.

This exercise should not take more than a few hours. It's okay to get creative but don't stress yourself out!
